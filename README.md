#Parse Helper Classes for Voice Recognition App

Description
====
These classes facilitate integration of our app with Parse.
It contains helper functions for location search, enforcing
tuple insertion/update/deletion constraints, etc.


Classes
====
InsertionClass helps with insertion tuples (verifying valid
phone numbers, duplicated phone numbers, etc.)

LocationClass updates user's location when log in. It also
searches for nearest X users to the current users.


Note
====
Work in progress. Also, all of Parse.h code is commented out
because this is not integrated with Parse's API yet.
